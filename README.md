# NTI Final Project – Power BI Program

This project represents my final submission for the **NTI (National Telecommunication Institute)** Data Analysis track   
It focuses on building a complete **Power BI dashboard**, from data modeling to creating insights and interactive visuals.

The dataset wasn’t fully complete and had some inconsistencies, but it was a great opportunity to practice **data cleaning, DAX calculations**, and **dashboard design** — and to experience working with real-world imperfect data.

**Main Steps**
-Built a proper **data model** and defined relationships (Star Schema).  
-Created a **Date Table** with hierarchies (Year → Quarter → Month → Day).  
-Wrote DAX measures for:
  - Total Sales  
  - Profit & Profit Margin  
  - Avg / Max / Min Unit Price  
-Designed multiple report pages:
  - Sales Through Years  
  - Profit in Regions  
  - Sales Statistics  
- Improved visuals, slicers, and layout for a clean and professional look.

**Tools Used**
-Power BI  
-DAX  
-Data Modeling  
-Data Visualization
